# early-detection-of-ventricular-bigeminy-trigeminy-rhythms
Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC) is an arrhythmia that can be associated with several cardiac disorders that affect from 40% to 75% of the general population. PVC occurrence is measure from Electrocardiogram (ECG). If in an ECG occur one (or two) PVC between two Normal heartbeats, then there is a Ventricular Bigeminy (or Trigeminy). The prevalence of Ventricular Bigeminy/Trigeminy rhythms was associated with angina, hypertension, congestive heart failure and myocardial infarction. For this, early detection of these rhythms is very important. In this work it is proposed a new approach for early diagnosis of these rhythms, which is based on Random Forest algorithm and information about previous heartbeat and heart rhythm. Thus, the proposed approach uses only the information before occurrence of Ventricular Bigeminy/Trigeminy. This simple approach was capable of predict the Bigeminy/Trigeminy occurrence with accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 98.94%, 96.28% and 99.83, respectively. Furthermore, the results show that the Ventricular Bigeminy/Trigeminy is preceded for Normal, A-V junctional and Paced heart rhythms in most of the examples. Besides that, it is presented a simple algorithm for decision about the occurrence of Ventricular Bigeminy/Trigeminy rhythms.
